REQUIREMENTS - FastSLAM Project

Core Algorithm Requirements:
- FastSLAM 1.0 implementation using particle filtering + landmark EKFs
- Accurate motion model and noise simulation
- Sensor model for very noisy map sensor
- Measurement likelihood computation
- Effective resampling technique (low variance preferred)

Filtering Requirements:
- Fuse noisy sensor map with SLAM-based filtered map
- Maintain uncertainty representation (covariances)
- Reject incorrect or extreme sensor readings

Navigation Requirements:
- Goal representation (x, y)
- Path planning from estimated pose to goal
- Controller to drive robot toward goal

Software Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Numpy, Matplotlib
- Modular code structure for simulator, SLAM, and visualization
- Reproducible experiments
