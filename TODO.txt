TODO LIST - FastSLAM Project

1. Implement full FastSLAM 1.0 pipeline:
   - Particle representation (pose + landmark EKFs)
   - Motion prediction step (using noisy odometry)
   - Sensor update step (EKF landmark updates)
   - Weight update based on measurement likelihood
   - Low‑variance resampling

2. Improve sensor quality through filtering:
   - Apply FastSLAM-based map filtering
   - Implement sensor noise models
   - Add observation gating / outlier rejection
   - Fuse simulated map sensor with particle-based estimates

3. Integrate very noisy map sensor:
   - Define noise model for map sensor
   - Create fusion logic combining sensor map + SLAM map
   - Compare filtered vs. raw sensor output

4. Navigation to goal:
   - Add goal specification
   - Use SLAM-corrected pose
   - Plan path based on updated map
   - Implement simple controller to reach goal

5. Debugging & visualization:
   - Plot particles, map, covariances
   - Plot sensor noise vs filtered map
   - Evaluate convergence quality
